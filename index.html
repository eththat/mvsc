          <p>Mountain View Smart Contracts is a cooperative research group, established in April 2016, in Mountain View, CA.</p>
          <p>We study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a> and systems level design using blockchain technology.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/complete/">Rich Bodo</a> is the current principal and lead designer of our projects to date.</p>
	  <p>Our recent activities:</p>
	  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>In late 2016 and early 2017, we successfully designed, built, and supported the live deployment of the World Food Programmes <a href="http://innovation.wfp.org/project/building-blocks">building blocks</a> prototype in Pakistan before handing it off to a much more capable <a href="https://www.parity.io/">team</a>. This is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y50C2JEZMrQ">video</a> recap. It was originally pitched at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/235228428/">Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup</a>. The code repo for that one is private, but the project is ongoing within the WFP.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In 2017 we conducted research into creating new connections between peer-production and markets.  This work is sponsored, in part, by <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/about">Mozilla</a>.  The <a href="https://github.com/bugmark">Repo</a> is active and research is ongoing. Some <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~malvika/MRao_WEIS2018.pdf">research (1)</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365%2Fs40702-018-00474-6">papers (2)</a> have been published on that work and at least two companies are being formed to productize that research.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In 2018 we began work on market infastructure for the space industry with <a href="https://www.spacebase.co">SpaceBase</a>.  In 2019 we began work on market infrastructure for the health care industry with <a href="https://coverus.health/">CoverUs</a>.  Both of those projects are ongoing and we hope to publish some work from those projects soon.
